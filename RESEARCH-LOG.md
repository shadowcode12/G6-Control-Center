# OEM research log

## Scope

Understand the installed GIGABYTE/CLEVO application architecture on the owner's G6 KF to inform an independent implementation. Do not copy OEM implementation code, redistribute OEM binaries, patch installed executables, or issue unknown hardware writes.

## Observed evidence

- The visible system interface includes System, FlexiCharger, LED Keyboard and Flexikey modules.
- The installed `CLEVOCO.FnhotkeysandOSD` package is x64 and contains a `FnKey\CC40\CC40.exe` application.
- The inspected `CC40.exe` is a PE32+ x64 executable with CLR metadata; its package contains WPF-related assemblies, Actipro WPF assemblies and GalaSoft MVVM Light assemblies.
- The package contains multiple native libraries and helper executables, including names associated with DCHU, HID, NVIDIA, keyboard LED and Intel tuning functionality.
- `DCHUService.exe` is registered as the Control Center Hotkey Service. `HKClipSvc.exe` is also present in the ControlCenter driver folder.

## Important limitations

- A bundled DLL does not prove that every feature is active on this laptop or called by CC40 at runtime.
- Function names and imports are leads, not a complete hardware protocol specification.
- Fan control, EC writes, power limits, GPU switching and battery thresholds remain unimplemented until model-specific capabilities and safe bounds are established.
- Do not run unverified IOCTLs or write arbitrary EC/ACPI values.

## Next research tasks

1. Decompile the user's own CC40 binary with ILSpy and map namespaces/ViewModels without redistributing proprietary code.
2. Identify read-only device capability queries and exact supported model identifiers.
3. Correlate sensor values with trusted Windows telemetry sources.
4. Determine which features can be implemented using documented Windows APIs and which require a signed vendor driver or firmware support.
